Alves under the supervision of Prof. Emerson Del Ponte, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, MG, Brazil.

  The main objective of the reseach was to estimate the time-varying apparent infection rate of simulated disease epidemics using a data assimilation method called Particle Filter and compare its results to an arrangement of the logistic model to obtain the between two time points.
